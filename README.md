# Assignment1
An example Makefile is provided. Modify it to compile your shell. Dummy files shell.c and ls.c are given here. The main shell binary must be named "shell". Modify ls.c or delete it if not required and put all other files that are there.
The way to work with this project is to run the shell.c and run the ./a.out with that apply the commands and we are good to go. 
we have divided our code in systematic manner so that debugging tasks could be made simpler there are header files containg the bits and pieces of the code.
